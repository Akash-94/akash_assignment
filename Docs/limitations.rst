Limitations:
============

There are a few limitations to this data pipeline, owing to the scarcity of time these could not be incorporated in the code.

1. **Error Handling**

The code contains try-except blocks for catching exceptions but it logs the error without raising or handling it further.

2. **Data Quality Checks**

The code doesn't include any data integrity checks or transformations before writing to the database.

3. **Unit Testing**

Unit test cases to check the functionality of each function and test to handle various other scenarios were omitted.

4. **Packaging and Versioning**

Packaging is not achieved and the code could have been more organized and structured. 
Versioning of the pipeline is not maintained to track changes or to use previous versions of the code.
